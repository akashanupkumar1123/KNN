You've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.

We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

Let's grab it and use it!



Standardize the VariablesÂ¶
Because the KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters. Any variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger effect on the distance between the observations, and hence on the KNN classifier, than variables that are on a small scale.


Using KNN
Remember that we are trying to come up with a model to predict whether someone will TARGET CLASS or not. We'll start with k=1.


Choosing a K Value
Let's go ahead and use the elbow method to pick a good K Value
